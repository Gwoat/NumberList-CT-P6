In order to use the List Search program, you have to first run it.
Once You have done this it should give you a list of options each with there own function relevant to their title.
Input which option you would like to do (Should be an integer)
Your option should be coherent (Not searching before adding numbers to a list)
Recursive Search is a function that repeats its self within its function to get a result.
The iterative search is when the function runs using its self in a while loop till it finds its result.
Linear search is when the function checks each individual number in the list if it is x.
The function I would like to add to the program would be a random search type function, where you 
1. Give a range of numbers
2. It searches randomly between the range with the numbers that are in your list
3. Once it has done this, and a number has been picked it will see what criteria the number meets to 
enable a seperate function(in this case it would probably be what the number is divisible by, and the function would be a search called from it.)
